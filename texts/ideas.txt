1)  Modify the single-item view so that it loads next and previous pages in the background before displaying them?
2)  Cookies and session data? <- maybe storing the highest seen current page in the session data and not letting the next and previous links for full pages extend beyond that?
3)  A page that lists all items of a certain type at the current point in the story. (or maybe shows 25 at a time?)
	1)  The url for this needs to be in the following format: /lists/[TYPE NAME]/[PAGE NUMBER] - example: /lists/characters/40
	2)  There needs to be a constant in the config for "lists" the same way that there's a variable for "pages".
4)  html for confusing lines is parsed in import.php - I need to make it so that it's not parsed.
5)  In fn_parse_descriptions, I should comment what each of the variables does. 'cause there are a lot of 'em.
6)  Links to a source page with a specific URI
7)  Add the code for section headers and footers
8)  Go through all the #####

--- Additional variables that I need to make
* SECTION_HEAD - the parsed content of the section header
* SECTION_FOOT - the parsed content of the section footer
* LIST_URL - the URL for the list of this type
* SOURCE_URI [URI] - creates a URL in the format of: PROTOCOL . "://" . REFERER_BASE . [THE URI PROVIDED]
