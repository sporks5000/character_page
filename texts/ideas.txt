1)  Allow a document to be set as the 404 page
2)  In any case where we'd redirect to the main page, if there is a 404 page, redirect to the 404 page
3)  If we're supposed to redirect to the main page, but there is no main page, redirect to the main page of the source.
4)  Update the documentation to explain the above.
