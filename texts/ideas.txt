1)  Modify the single-item view so that it loads next and previous pages in the background before displaying them?
2)  Cookies and session data? <- maybe storing the highest seen current page in the session data and not letting the next and previous links for full pages extend beyond that?
3)  html for confusing lines is parsed in import.php - I need to make it so that it's not parsed.
4)  In fn_parse_descriptions, I should comment what each of the variables does. 'cause there are a lot of 'em.
5)  Go through all the #####
6)  A 404 page
7)  When defining anything that requires a page number, instead require the URI, then the import process should convert the URI to a page number
	1)  Similarly, the export process should convert the page number back to a URI
