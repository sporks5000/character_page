1)  Modify the single-item view so that it loads next and previous pages in the background before displaying them.
2)  Should the "initialization" page remove itself? Should it transform into the import page after initialization has occurred?
3)  a way to remove content?
4)  a way to export content
5)  cookies and session data? <- maybe storing the highest seen current page in the session data and not letting the next and previous links for full pages extend beyond that?
6)  instead of redirecting to a different page if the URL isn't in the requested format, just change the text in the URL bar <- maybe impossible?
7)  A page that shows all items of a certain type at the current point in the story.
8)  a main page
